# ORTE-backend

Simple, straightforward backend for creating and managing places/POIs (or in german "Orte") and additional informations of a web-based map. Output is a public available API w/JSON and exportable as CSV/JSON/GeoJSON.

Based on Ruby on Rails 5, MySQL/MariaDB, jQuery, Leaflet and Foundation 6.

This application is work in progress. Contributions are welcome (see below).

## Address and geolocation lookup

This application uses [Nominatim](https://nominatim.openstreetmap.org/), a search engine for OpenStreetMap data to look up address and geolocation data. By implementing this application you should respect the [Nominatim Usage Policy](https://operations.osmfoundation.org/policies/nominatim/)!

## Installation

Basic steps for a local installation on your machine:

### Requirements

* Webserver (Apache, NGINX)
* Ruby 2.6+, RVM, Rubygems
* MySQL/Maria DB
* ffmpeg (for the video feature), ImageMagick (for the image feature)

### Get repository

```bash
$ git clone git@github.com:ut/ORTE-backend.git
```
### Prepare Rails

```bash
$ gem install bundler
$ bundle install
```

### Setup MySQL/Maria DB

```bash
$ sudo mysql -u root
> CREATE USER 'user'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'password';
> GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON *.* TO 'user'@'localhost';
> CREATE DATABASE orte CHARACTER SET utf8 COLLATE utf8_general_ci;
> exit;
$ bundle exec rails db:schema:load
$ bundle exec rails db:seed
```

### Credentials + deployment

If you need custom credentials, e.g for a server installation, you can secre them with rails credentials and a master.key. Edit the credentials with

```bash
$ EDITOR=vim bundle exec rails credentials:edit
