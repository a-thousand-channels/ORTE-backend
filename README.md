# ORTE-backend

Simple, straightforward backend for creating and managing places/POIs (or in german "Orte") and additional informations of a web-based map. Output is a public available API w/JSON and exportable as CSV/JSON.

Based on Ruby on Rails 5, Postgres, jQuery, Leaflet and Foundation 6.

This application is work in progress. Contributions are welcome (see below).

This application uses [Nominatim](https://nominatim.openstreetmap.org/), a search engine for OpenStreetMap data to look up address and geolocation data. By implementing this application you should respect the [Nominatim Usage Policy](https://operations.osmfoundation.org/policies/nominatim/)!
