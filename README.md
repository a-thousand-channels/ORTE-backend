# ORTE-backend

Backend application for creating and managing places/POIs (or in german "Orte"),  formatted text and assets like images, audio and video on a web-based map. Additionally relations between places can be set. Output is a public available API w/JSON or exportable as CSV/JSON/GeoJSON data. It has also some extra features like visualising relations between places and a map to go feature (see below).

Based on Ruby on Rails 5, MySQL/MariaDB, jQuery, Leaflet and Foundation 6.

Contributions to this application are appreciated (see below).

## Address and geolocation lookup

This application uses [Nominatim](https://nominatim.openstreetmap.org/), a search engine for OpenStreetMap data to look up address and geolocation data. By implementing this application you should respect the [Nominatim Usage Policy](https://operations.osmfoundation.org/policies/nominatim/)!

## Map to go feature

ORTE Backend ist basically a backend which provides JSON and GeoJSON export of its layers and map. Since version 0.7 offers a "map to go" feature, where user can generate a static, Nuxt.js based website from their single layer (and its places) and place this site on their webspace. So you can get your frontend website and all defined data directly out of the application.

## Installation

Basic steps for a local installation on your machine:

### Requirements

* Webserver (e.g. Apache or NGINX)
* Ruby 2.7+, RVM, Rubygems
* MySQL/Maria DB
* ffmpeg (for the video feature), ImageMagick (for the image feature)
* Redis

### Get repository

```bash
$ git clone git@github.com:a-thousand-channels/ORTE-backend.git
```
### Prepare Rails

```bash
$ gem install bundler
$ bundle install
```

### Setup MySQL/Maria DB

```bash
$ sudo mysql -u root
> CREATE USER 'user'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'password';
> GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON *.* TO 'user'@'localhost';
> CREATE DATABASE orte CHARACTER SET utf8 COLLATE utf8_general_ci;
> exit;
$ bundle exec rails db:schema:load
$ bundle exec rails db:seed
```

### Credentials

If you need custom credentials, e.g for your database setup or mailer settings necessary for a server installation, you can secure them with rails credentials and a master.key. Edit the credentials with

```bash
$ EDITOR=vim bundle exec rails credentials:edit
```

### Optional: Mapbox Token for satellite imagery

You can define your mapbox token in the credentials (token[:mapbox])


### Run application locally

```bash
$ bundle exec rails s
```

### Test applocation locally


```bash
$ RAILS_ENV=test bundle exec rails db:migrate
$ RAILS_ENV=test COVERAGE=true bundle exec rspec spec
```
