## [0.71] - 2022-10-03

This release contains some nice improvements and customization for the display of tile layers, map center and the markers on the map.

It's now possible, to set the background (tile layer) per map and per layer. There a some pre-set tile layers, like OSM, satellite or plain background. It is also possible to define a custom tile layer by providing a valid tile layer URL.

The selection per map will be rendered to the backend and will be part of the JSON export. A user working in the backend has now the option to switch temporarily to one of the default or the custom tile layer (if one is set).

Some minor improvements to the map has been made, like the option to set a custom map center and the user option to select between different marker display options (point, text label, image label and relations between points, if defined)

Each place can have one or more annotations (e.g. quotes), every annotation has a n:1 relation wie a person. With this release, the people model is
